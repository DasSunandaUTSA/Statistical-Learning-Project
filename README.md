Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM and their Performance in Predicting Bank Customer Churn 

This project compares the performance of Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM in predicting whether or not a client would quit a bank. Customers exiting is counter productive since banks make money by leveraging their customers' deposits. Banks may build business efforts to appeal to such clients and better keep them by developing a model that can anticipate who might leave. 

Data Source: Kaggle (The dataset is originally from a US bank, though the geography suggests this project only considered its European clients. The dataset contains 10,000 observations.)
